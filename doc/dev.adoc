== Developer's Guide

As noted in the first bullet point of Appendix A, I intend to add developer documentation reflecting my learning as I read the code and consult Nassib. The following skeleton is work in progress, and will therefore be of no use to anyone but me, for now at least.


=== Directory structure

* `mdb` is an old client for the `metadb` server.  It probably is legacy code and probably should be removed.

* The list of top-level features mentioned at the start of https://metadb.dev/doc/[the user documentation] is probably worth using as a high-level overview of the code:
  ** streaming data sources
    *** In principle, multiple kinds of source: so far, only kafka
  ** data model transforms
  ** historical data
