=== Server configuration

Metadb makes use of local storage in a "data directory," which is
created using `metadb` with the `init` command.  In this example we
will create the data directory as `data/`:

[source,bash]
----
metadb init -D data
----

This will also create a file `metadb.conf` in the data directory:

[source,toml]
----
[postgresql]
host =
database_name =
postgres_password =
metadb_user =
metadb_password =
----

This file should be edited to add connection parameters, for example:

[source,toml]
----
[postgresql]
host = a.b.c
database_name = mydb
postgres_password = zpreCaWS7S79dt82zgvD
metadb_user = metadb
metadb_password = ZHivGie5juxGJZmTObHU
----
