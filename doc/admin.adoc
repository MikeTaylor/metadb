=== Server configuration

Metadb makes use of local storage in a "data directory," which is
created using `metadb` with the `init` command.  In this example we
will create the data directory as `data/`:

[source,bash]
----
metadb init -D data
----

This will also create a file `metadb.conf` in the data directory:

[source,toml]
----
[main]
host =
port =
database =
superuser =
superuser_password =
systemuser =
systemuser_password =
sslmode =
----

This file should be edited to add connection parameters, for example:

[source,toml]
----
[main]
host = a.b.c
port = 5432
database = mydb
superuser = postgres
superuser_password = zpreCaWS7S79dt82zgvD
systemuser = metadb
systemuser_password = ZHivGie5juxGJZmTObHU
sslmode = require
----
